I'm currently a programming student at Arkansas Student University. My main focus as mentioned earlier is programming.
I like to meddle with software and game development. I hope to eventually land a job in game or software design/development.

Currently most comfortable with C++ and C#. I've done work in the past with Java and Python as well.
